-- | An FSet (for FieldML set) is more general than a topological space or topological manifold for that matter.  FieldML domains qualify as topological spaces.

  -- | Lambda x expr1 represents a lambda, binding x in the expression represented by expr1. 
  -- Thus, if g = Lambda x expr1, x has been bound, and if x was a free variable in expr1, it is not a free variable in g.
  -- g will now be an object in SignatureSpace m n, m is the domain of expr1, and n is the codomain of expr1.  In other words, the Lambda does 
  -- not affect the domain and codomain. However, it does alter the free variables, since it binds x, i.e. x is removed from the free variables.  
  --
  -- x must be either a free variable or a variable tuple.
  -- A variable tuple is a tuple whose members are either free variables or variable tuples (note the recursive definition).
  -- The value produced by the map when a value for x is provided is described by g.   
  -- g must not have free variables that are not present in x
  --
  -- A simple example of where a Lambda is useful: 
  -- it allows for free variables to be specified that may not be present in f, for example Lambda x (RealConstant 1).
  Lambda Map Map |
  
  -- | Apply g x1 represents the application of a function g whose domain is m to a value represented by the expression x1, 
  -- x1 must be an element of m, in other words, codomain of x1 must equal m.
  -- Typically, g is declared as g = Lambda x f, which makes g an element of SignatureSpace m n
  Apply Map Map |
  
  -- | PartialApplication n f g results in a map h whose domain A cross B, 
  -- where A is the same as the domain of f but with the n-th factor removed from the domain, and the value from g used for that slot.
  -- and B is the domain of g as a single slot for the tuple that represents g's domain.
  -- Since any Map essentially is an expression in some variables, this is equivalent to using the value of g in place of the relevant variable.
  -- Note that this equivalent to function composition if f's domain is a single factor domain.
  
  -- Todo: consider using the name of a general variable that is part of the expression for f, rather than specifying the n'th slot. 
  -- Note however that would allow "deeper" binding, whereas the current approach only allows binding to any of the members of the top level
  -- tuple structure of the domain of f.
  -- Todo: contrast this style of partial application with function application in general, function composition, and variable substitution. Clarify apparent confusion.
  PartialApplication Int Map Map |
  
  -- Compose f g = f(g(x)), assumes f::b->c, g::a->b (i.e. domain/codomain compatibility).
  -- This is similar to PartialApplication in a way, except that the domain of f is treated as a single slot.
  Compose Map Map |
  
  -- | FromRealParameterSource xs f assumes that f is a GeneralVariable, or a Tuple of GeneralVariables, such that each GeneralVariable's FSet is Labels. The codomain of f must thus be the CartesianProduct of n discrete FSets, with a total cardinality equal to length xs.
  FromRealParameterSource [Double] Map |
  
  -- | See documentation for FromRealParameter source.
  FromIntegerParameterSource [Int] Map |

  -- | Project n f assumes f is a Tuple, and represents the n'th factor of the tuple.
  Project Int Map |

  -- | The given FSet must be a simple subdomain of the domain of the given map.
  Restriction FSet Map |
  
  -- | Max f Assumes codomain of f is Reals, and evaluates to maximum value that f attains over the domain of f.
  Max Map |
  
  -- | Same as Max, but evaluates to minimum value.
  Min Map |
  
  -- | Inverse f assumes that f is invertable, and represents the inverse function.
  Inverse Map |

  -- | h = KroneckerProduct fs requires each f in fs to be a 'Tuple's of reals, i.e. each member of the Tuple must have Reals as its codomain.
  -- The result is a Tuple whose length is the product of the lengths of of each f.
  -- For example, for the case where fs = [f,g], 
  -- h_i is f_j * g_k, where i = (j-1) * m + k, j=1..n, k=1..m and asterisk means scalar real multiplication.
  KroneckerProduct [Map] |
  
  -- | DistributedAccordingTo f g is true if f is distributed according to g, where g meets the requirements to serve 
  -- as a probability distribution for f.
  -- Informally, these requirements are:
  -- * g is real valued, i.e. the codomain of g is Reals.
  -- * The domain of g is the codomain of f, 
  -- * The domain of g must be a valid measure space. Note: canonical measure is assumed for Euclidean space and continuous subsets of Euclidian space.
  -- * The values taken by g are in the closed interval [0,1].
  -- * The integral of g over its domain is 1.
  DistributedAccordingTo Map Map |
  
  -- | DistributionFromRealisations fs requires that all Maps in fs have the same codomain as each other.
  -- It represents a Map whose domain is the codomain of f (where f is any member of fs), and whose codomain is Reals.
  -- Thus, if g = DistributionFromRealisations fs, g x is zero if x is not present in fs, and g x is equal to n/m if x is in fs, where 
  -- n is the number of times x occurs in fs, and m is length fs.
  -- This is analogous to distributionFromRealisations suggested by Andrew Miller and other designers of CellML uncertainty specification draft
  -- (see http://www.cellml.org/Members/miller/draft-secondary-spec-uncertainty/ July 2012)
