-- The ideas here were strongly influenced by Andrew Miller's open source "ModML", with some code copied directly from ModML for some of the early versions.

-- This is under construction
-- Todo list:
-- - Validation:
-- --Validate Maps like "And" to check that both operands have consistent domains, and codomains are boolean.
-- - Connectivity
-- - Tensor product basis functions
-- - Coordinate system transformation
-- - represent derivative continuity intention at connected points
-- - "Versions"
-- - Generate discretised points in a TopologicalSpace.
-- - Partial evaluation, binding, composition, projection from a general variable.


-- Done:
-- - Disjoint Union
