  -- Equivalent: MathML/OpenMath: <csymbol cd="quant1">exists</csymbol>

  -- | Interior m assumes m is a subset of m1. The domain of Interior m is m1. Interior m evaluates to true for all values x in m1 that are within the part of m1 bounded by m, or on m.

  -- | Lambda f g declares explicitly the free variables of a Map.  
  -- x is either a free variable or a variable tuple.  
  -- A variable tuple is a tuple whose members are either free variables or variable tuples (note the recursive definition).
  -- The value produced by the map when a value for x is provided is described by g.   
  -- g must not have free variables that are not present in x
  --
  -- Note that the free variables of a map can be inferred, but a Lambda is useful for at least two reasons:
  --  1) It allows the order of the free variables and the variable tuple structure to be explicitly specified.
  --  2) It allows for free variables to be specified that may not be present in g, for example Lambda x 1.
  Lambda Map Map |
  
  -- | PartialApplication n f g results in a map h whose domain A cross B, 
  -- where A is the same as the domain of f but with the n-th factor removed from the domain, and the value from g used for that slot.
  -- and B is the domain of g as a single slot for the tuple that represents g's domain.
  -- Since any Map essentially is an expression in some variables, this is equivalent to using the value of g in place of the relevant variable.
  PartialApplication Int Map Map |
  
  -- Compose f g = f(g(x)), assumes f::b->c, g::a->b (i.e. domain/codomain compatibility).
  -- This is similar to PartialApplication in a way, except that the domain of f is treated as a single slot.
  Compose Map Map |
  
  -- | FromRealParameterSource xs f assumes that f is a GeneralVariable, or a Tuple of GeneralVariables, such that each GeneralVariable's TopologicalSpace is Labels. The codomain of f must thus be the CartesianProduct of n discrete TopologicalSpaces, with a total cardinality equal to length xs.
  FromRealParameterSource [Double] Map |
  
  -- | See documentation for FromRealParameter source.
  FromIntegerParameterSource [Int] Map |

  -- | Project n f assumes f is a Tuple, and represents the n'th factor of the tuple.

  -- | The given topological space must be a simple subdomain of the domain of the given map.
  Restriction TopologicalSpace Map |
  
  -- | Max f Assumes codomain of f is Reals, and evaluates to maximum value that f attains over the domain of f.
  Max Map |
  
  -- | Same as Max, but evaluates to minimum value.
  Min Map |
  
  -- | Inverse f assumes that f is invertable, and represents the inverse function.
  Inverse Map |
  
  -- | h = KroneckerProduct f g requires f and g to be 'Tuple's of reals, i.e. each member of the Tuple must have Reals as its codomain.
  -- The result is a Tuple whose length is n times m, where n is the length of f and m is the length of g.
  -- h_i is f_j * g_k, where i = (j-1) * m + k, j=1..n, k=1..m and asterisk means scalar real multiplication).
