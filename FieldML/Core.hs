  -- g will now be an object in SignatureSpace m n, where m is the codomain of the free variables of x, and n is the codomain of expr.  
  -- Lambda alters the free variables, since it binds x, i.e. the free variables of g are the free variables of expr with x removed.  
  --
  -- x must be either a free variable or a variable tuple.
  -- A variable tuple is a tuple whose members are either free variables or variable tuples (note the recursive definition).

  -- This is a convenience for making lambdas from any expression.
  
  -- Todo: very much still just an experiment.
  Lambdify Expression |
  
  -- | Apply f x represents the application of a function f whose domain is m to a value represented by the expression x,

  Apply Expression Expression |
  
  -- | h = Compose f g means that h(x) = f(g(x)). It is only valid if f::b->c, g::a->b (i.e. domain/codomain compatibility).

  Compose Expression Expression |
  
  -- | If h = PartialApplication n f x then the domain of h is the same as the domain of f 
  -- but with the n-th factor removed from the domain, and the value from x used for that slot.

  -- | ElementOf x m represents a map that is true if x is in the set m, otherwise it is false.

  -- One application of interior is for specifying a region of interest by means of an outline, for example, a map whose image in the xy plane is a polygon can be used as the predicate for SimpleSubset.

  -- | See documentation for FromRealParameter source.

  -- | y = KroneckerProduct xs requires each x in xs to be a 'Tuple's of real valued functions, 
  -- i.e. each member of the Tuple must be a Lambda that has Reals as its codomain.
  -- The represented result is a Tuple whose length is the product of the lengths of of each x.
  -- For example, for the case where xs = [x1,x2], and x1 has m members, x2 has n members, then
  -- y_i is x1_j * x2_k, where i = (j-1) * n + k, j=1..m, k=1..n and asterisk means scalar real multiplication, and _ precedes the index.
  KroneckerProduct [Expression] |

  -- | DistributedAccordingTo x f is true if x is distributed according to f, where f meets the requirements to serve 
  -- as a probability distribution for x.
  -- Informally, these requirements are:
  -- * f is a Lambda whose domain is the same as x's FSet (i.e. x is an element of the domain of f)
  -- * f is real valued, i.e. the codomain of f is Reals.
  -- * The domain of f must be a valid measure space. Note: canonical measure is assumed for Euclidean space and continuous subsets of Euclidian space.
  -- * The values taken by f are in the closed interval [0,1].
  -- * The Lebesgue integral of f over its domain is 1.
  DistributedAccordingTo Expression Expression |
  
  -- | DistributionFromRealisations xs requires that all Expressions in xs are values on the same FSet which we will refer to as m.
  -- It represents a Lambda Expression whose domain m, and whose codomain is Reals.
  -- Thus, if g = DistributionFromRealisations xs, Apply g x is zero if x is not present in xs, otherwise it is equal to p/q, where 
  -- p is the number of times x occurs in xs, and q is length xs.
  -- This is analogous to distributionFromRealisations suggested by Andrew Miller and other designers of CellML uncertainty specification draft
  -- (see http://www.cellml.org/Members/miller/draft-secondary-spec-uncertainty/ July 2012)
